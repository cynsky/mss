agree on a set of classes (OWL?)

synchronize R class names with those in the OWL pattern

take care of time, space, spacetime;

take care of trajectories -- what if they measure ambient air
temperature? -> coerce to ST Geostatistical variable?

coercion ppp <--> PointPatternDataFrame

document exported classes

do all classes need ObservationWindows? (geost, lattice: no?)
