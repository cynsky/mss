# Spatial fields and entities

## Support, Domain, and Observation Window
This document introduces two classes for spatial data: `SpatialField`
and `SpatialEntities`, for representing spatial fields, and entities,
respectively. For both, the support of the variable is explicitly tracked. 
Support refers to the physical size of data (observations or model
predictions). A synonym for support is _footprint_.

## a support class and method
We define a support class as
```{r}
library(mss) # meaningful spatial statistics
showClass("Support")
```
and can create a few instances by
```{r}
defaultSupport = Support()
featureSupport = Support("feature")
pointSupport = Support("point")
fnSupport = Support(fn = function(x) x) # identity function
```

# Domain and observation windows
The window class defines an area, either represented by a grid or by a polygon:
```{r}
showClass("Window")
```

After loading the `meuse` data set from `sp`,
```{r}
library(sp)
demo(meuse, ask = FALSE, echo = FALSE)
sapply(ls(), function(x) class(get(x)))
meuse[1:5, 1:5]
```
we can define for instance a window for the observation points data 
set by the `meuse.grid` data,
```{r}
w2 = Window(sp = meuse.grid) # note the grid is passed, not the polygons
```
or by using the area as single polygon:
```{r}
w1 = Window(sp = meuse.area)
```

We define spatial data objects as having support, and either having
an observation window (for entities) or a domain (for fields).
```{r}
showClass("SpatialField")
showClass("SpatialEntities")
```

## Examples

### interpolation of point support data
We can predict to points, laid out regularly, inside a polygon
```{r}
m = SpatialField(meuse, "point", meuse.area) # data are point support
i1 = interpolate(log(zinc)~1, m, support = "point") # interpolate from point TO point support
spplot(i1, "var1.pred")
```

or we can predict the polygon area mean value:
```{r}
library(rgeos)
i2 = interpolate(log(zinc)~1, m, support = "feature") # interpolate from point TO polygon support
i2$var1.pred # a single value, estimate of mean for the whole area
mean(log(m$zinc)) # sample mean
mean(i1$var1.pred) # mean of predictions, similar to i2$var1.pred
```
We can repeat this with a domain, defined by the `meuse.grid` object, by
predicting to point support values for points on a grid
```{r}
m = SpatialField(meuse, "point", meuse.grid)
i3 = interpolate(log(zinc)~1, m, support = "point")
print(as(i3[1:3,], "data.frame"), digits = 10) # point support
```
or predict values for cell means:
```{r}
i4 = interpolate(log(zinc)~1, m, support = "feature") # interpolate from point TO feature (cell) support
print(as(i4[1:3,], "data.frame"), digits = 10) # grid cells support
spplot(i4, "var1.pred")
```

## support of the feature
Suppose we have grid data on a 3 x 3 grid, and
want to estimate on a new location, indicated by a red
circle:
```{r}
set.seed(131)
gt = GridTopology(cellcentre.offset = c(0,0), cellsize = c(1,1), cells.dim = c(3,3))
sgdf = SpatialGridDataFrame(SpatialGrid(gt), 
	data.frame(r = round(runif(9, max = 10), 1)))
plot(as(sgdf, "SpatialPolygons"), axes = TRUE)
text(coordinates(sgdf), labels = sgdf[[1]])
pt.red = SpatialPoints(cbind(0.25, 0.25))
points(pt.red, col = 'red', pch = 1)
```

The first case is when the grid cell data represent
point support values at the grid cell centre, which
is identical to case `i1` above:
```{r}
sf = SpatialField(as(sgdf, "SpatialPointsDataFrame"), "point", sgdf)
i5 = interpolate(r~1, sf, "point", newdata = pt.red)
as(i5[1,], "data.frame")
```
The second case, grid cells represent constant area with
point support value, meaning that every point location within
a grid cell has the value of the grid cell assigned:
```{r}
sf = SpatialField(sgdf, "point", sgdf)
i6 = interpolate(r~1, sf, "point", newdata = pt.red)
as(i6[1,], "data.frame")
```
as case (...) above, we can predict a mean value for a grid cell by
```{r}
gt = GridTopology(cellcentre.offset = c(.25,.25), cellsize = c(1,1), cells.dim = c(1,1))
grd.red = SpatialGrid(gt)
i7 = interpolate(r~1, sf, "feature", newdata = grd.red)
i7@sp@data
```


## area-to-point kriging
```{r}
sp = as(sgdf, "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame")
gf = SpatialField(sp, "feature")
library(gstat)
kr = interpolate(r~1, gf, "feature", newdata = pt.red, 
	vgm = vgm(1, "Exp", 5, 0))
kr@sp[[1]]
krige0(r ~ 1, sp, pt.red, vgm_area, vgm = vgm(1, "Exp", 5, 0))
```

## grid-to-grid kriging
```{r}
sp = as(sgdf, "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame")
gr = as(grd.red, "SpatialPolygons")
grd = addAttrToGeom(gr, data.frame(r=0), FALSE)
plot(as(sgdf, "SpatialPolygons"), axes = TRUE)
text(coordinates(sgdf), labels = sgdf[[1]])
plot(grd, add = TRUE, border = 'red')
kr = interpolate(r~1, gf, "feature", newdata = grd, 
	vgm = vgm(1, "Exp", 5, 0))
kr@sp[[1]]
krige0(r ~ 1, sp, grd, vgm_area, vgm = vgm(1, "Exp", 5, 0))
```

## density for entitities
```{r}
e = SpatialEntities(meuse, "point", meuse.area)
spplot(density(e, newdata = meuse.grid)@sp, sp.layout = list(
	list("sp.polygons", meuse.area, border = grey(.5)), 
	list("sp.points", meuse, col = 'green')))
```

## aggregate: meaningful
generate warnings of mip/mss

## TODOs
* verify that SpatialPixel objects do not have anyDuplicated(x@grid.index), for domain, or sp
* think functional support through: is it needed? How does it link to predict.gstat?
* grid cells: (i) constant value in grid cells: support = "point";
(ii) single value for aggregate of grid cell: support = "feature";
(iii) single value only valid for grid cell centre: object needs
to be coercer to SpatialPoints and support = "point"
* check whether multiple polygons work!
* check whether observations match domain

## functional support
```{r}
f4x4 = function(size) {
	grd = size * expand.grid(x = c(-3, -1, 1, 3), y = c(-3, -1, 1, 3)) / 8
	n = nrow(grd)
	function(x = 0, y = 0) as.matrix(cbind(rep(x,n),rep(y,n)) + grd)
}
f = f4x4(2)
f() # centered at (0,0)
f(10,5) # centered at (10,5)
```
